# PHASEONE
In PHASEONE is funded with $10k USD which is split into two baskets:
 - 60% BTC for sport speculation [$6,000]
 - 40% Fund of Layer One Cryptocurrencies outlined [$4,000]
 
The $6k betting book is then divided thusly:
 - $4k Round Robin Wagers
 - $1k during-the-contest wagers
 - $1k buffer

## The Round Robin Wagers:
Each week the betting odds go up for the upcoming UFC Fight Night (Saturday)
If any of the match up include odds of -200, they are placed in a round robin bet. (Images coming soon.)
A Round Robin Wager is placed into three equally divided parts on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The odds change throughout the week so the three bets are made to even out the movement.

## During The Contests:
During the contest, $1k is set aside to bet during the competitions. There is an art to this. It's also terribly thrilling. Having a pre-set limit is helps maintain discipline.

## Notes on strategy:
The odds reflect spectator sentiment about the athletes ahead of the contest. All that is publicly known on the athlete is baked into this ratio. It changes regularly up until the contest. And at the time of the contest, ratio is 'live'

This Speculation on fights isn't betting on the fighters as much it relies on the knowledge of the spectators. The bet is that the audience is generally right about its knowledge of the athletes. By betting on the odds -in the extreme cases of -200 or more- you are leveraging public sentiment. It's a primitive form derivative trading. 

There is the added benefit that there are many contests on a single fight card. This allows for the bets to be spread out into a variety of ways.
Combat sports ultimately involve two athletes. And the outcome is generally, 50/50.
